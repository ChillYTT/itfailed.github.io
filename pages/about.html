<h1 align="center" style="padding-top:30px;">History</h1>
<p class="History">&emsp;&emsp;Prior to my website, there was another website. More popular than mine has ever been. It went by the name of I-AM-NOT-A-GOAT.weebly.com. It was the website everyone used to play games. But in May of 2018, the administrators blocked it for the first time. That was the downfall of I-AM-NOT-A-GOAT. It was later rebuilt on a few seperate locations. The first being on a google sites webpage and later onto an altervista domain. It never regained the traction that it had and is now deprecated because the owner has graduated and sees no reason to work on it (which makes sense).</p>
<p class="History">&emsp;&emsp;But when the I-AM-NOT-A-GOAT weebly went down for the first time, I saw an oppurtunity. I made my first website which was intended to replace I am not a goat. It went by the name of <a href="http://itbroken.weebly.com">itbroken.weebly.com.</a> A play of words on I am not a goat being broken. Now my website was up for a little bit but eventually got blocked. So I made another when I got back to school in September of 2018 by the name of <a href="http://itbrokeagain.weebly.com">itbrokeagain.weebly.com</a>. That one stayed up for nearly 4 months till christmas break. So I did what every sane person would do, and I made another. It went by the name of <a href="http://itbrokethrice.weebly.com">itbrokethrice.weebly.com</a>. But this one got blocked in less then a few weeks. At this point I had nearly given up.</p>
<p class="History" style="padding-bottom:50px;">&emsp;&emsp; It was always a  pain to redo all of these every time they blocked it, so I decided on April 9 of 2019 to start a new website, built by my own hands, from scratch. The first version of the website went live on April 9 of 2019. It lasted the longest out of all my websites with getting a max of 500 daily users by the time of iframe blocking. Iframe blocking was the base of unblocking sites. And now that the main method of unblocking was no longer exploitable, new methods had to be made. So I searched for months and racked my brain on how this could be done. At the point where I had an idea. What if I used a proxy? I found one and now that is what everything runs on. But nevertheless, on January 29 of 2020, the administarators blocked the domains of *.github.com and *.herokuapp.com. I had to get inventive, so I got my own domains and started to put the websites on those, so they have to individually block every single one. And that is where we stand today. Still going strong on feburary of 2020.</p>
